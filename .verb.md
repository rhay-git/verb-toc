**HEADS UP!!!** 

This only works with Verb v0.9.0 and higher! (also works with [assemble][]).

## Usage

```js
var toc = require('{%= name %}');
```

**Basic example**

In your `verbfile.js`:

```js
module.exports = function(verb) {
  verb.extendWith(require('verb-toc'));
  // do stuff, render templates, write files
};
```

Add a `<!-- toc -->` HTML comment to any markdown document where you want a table of contents to be injected. For the TOC middleware to run, you'll need to either call the `postLayout` and `preWrite` middleware handlers yourself, or follow the example below.

## Docs

**Middleware**

The main export is a function that when invoked with an instance of `verb` will automatically register two middleware functions:

- a `.postLayout` (`createToc`) middleware that creates the table of contents after a layout has been applied
- a `.preWrite` (`injectToc`) middleware that injects the table of contents back into the document after all other plugins have run. 

Both middleware functions are also exposed as properties on `module.exports`, so you can try other stages if you want. Be warned that there are pros and cons to most middleware stages, in my own experience these stages work really well and seem to result in the fewest unwanted side-effects.

**Register the middleware**

In your `verbfile.js`:

```js
module.exports = function(verb) {
  verb.extendWith(require('verb-toc'));
  
  // use any template engine, but you must call `.renderFile` 
  // (below) to trigger the necessary middleware stages
  verb.engine('*', require('engine-base'));

  // example task
  verb.task('docs', function(cb) {
    return verb.src('docs/*.md', { cwd: __dirname })
      .pipe(app.renderFile('*'))
      .pipe(verb.dest('dist'));
  });

  verb.task('default', ['docs']);
};
```

_(In v0.9.0 and higher, verbfiles that export a function are recognized by verb as "generators", allowing them to be locally or globally installed, and composed with other generators. You can alternatively export an instance of verb, but it's not as fun...)_
